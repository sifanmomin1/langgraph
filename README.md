## ✨ What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation with advanced AI workflows. Explore agentic reasoning, prompt chaining, sentiment analysis, and more—all in Python, with a focus on clarity and modularity.

## 🧩 LangGraph Workflow Components

LangGraph empowers you to build and experiment with a variety of workflow patterns for LLMs:

### 🔗 Sequential Workflow
- **Description:** Tasks are executed one after another, where the output of one step feeds directly into the next.
- **Use Case:** Stepwise reasoning, multi-stage prompt engineering, or any process where order matters.

### ⚡ Parallel Workflow
- **Description:** Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously, allowing you to leverage LLMs for concurrent processing.
- **Use Case:** Batch sentiment analysis, parallel data enrichment, or comparing multiple prompt strategies at once.

### 🔀 Conditional Edges
- **Description:** The workflow dynamically branches based on intermediate results or model outputs, enabling decision-based flows.
- **Use Case:** Routing customer feedback to different agents based on sentiment, or choosing different solution paths for a problem.

### 🔁 Iterative Workflow
- **Description:** Steps are repeated in a loop until a certain condition is met, supporting iterative refinement or repeated querying.
- **Use Case:** Re-asking an LLM until a satisfactory answer is found, or iterative optimization tasks.

Each notebook demonstrates one or more of these workflow patterns—helping you master modular,
